# 16-Point-FFT---ASIC-Design-Flow
VLSI Mini Project 2022-23
1) The project aims to compute the DFT of 16-point sequence using the fft algorithm and involves ASIC design for the same.
2) It requires the use of Quartus Prime (EDA tool) and Questa Sim simulator for Synthesis and Simulation.
3) The backend physical design flow is carried out on OpenLane, an open-source tool, and the Skywater130nm technology file is used as the pdk file.
